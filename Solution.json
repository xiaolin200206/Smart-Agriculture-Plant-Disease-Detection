        "prevention": "Prevention focuses on good pruning practices. Make clean cuts and avoid pruning during heavy rain, which can spread fungal spores. Protect large pruning wounds with a sealant. Maintain overall vine health.",
        "who_to_contact": "This is a serious disease. Consult a professional viticulture advisor or your local agricultural extension specialist for guidance on diagnosis and vine surgery techniques."

    "Raspberry___healthy": {
        "Description": "Great news! Your raspberry canes appear healthy. Look for strong, upright canes (primocanes and floricanes), lush green leaves, and the development of flowers and berries without spots or mold.",
        "treatment_and_control": "No treatment is required for healthy raspberry plants. Focus on maintaining the conditions that allow them to thrive.",
        "prevention": "To keep raspberries productive and disease-free: 1. Prune out old, fruited floricanes after harvest. 2. Thin primocanes to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration. 3. Trellis the canes to keep them off the ground. 4. Manage weeds and ensure good drainage.",
        "who_to_contact": "For specific pruning instructions based on your raspberry type (summer-bearing vs. everbearing), consult your local nursery or agricultural extension office."

    "Tomato___Leaf_Mold": {
        "Description": "Leaf Mold is a fungal disease caused by Passalora fulva, primarily affecting greenhouse tomatoes. The initial symptom is pale green or yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface, with a distinctive olive-green to brownish, velvety mold growing on the corresponding lower leaf surface.",
        "treatment_and_control": "Once present, leaf mold is difficult to control. Some fungicides can be effective, but reducing humidity is the most critical step. Remove and destroy infected lower leaves to slow the disease's progression.",
        "prevention": "The key to prevention is reducing humidity and improving air circulation. Ensure adequate spacing between plants, prune lower leaves, and provide good ventilation in greenhouses. Avoid wetting the leaves when watering. Plant resistant varieties.",
        "who_to_contact": "For greenhouse management techniques and resistant variety recommendations, contact your local agricultural extension office."

    "Tomato___Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite": {
        "Description": "Spider Mites, particularly the Two-Spotted Spider Mite, are not insects but are more closely related to spiders. They are common pests on tomatoes, especially in hot, dry conditions. They feed by piercing plant cells, causing tiny yellow or white speckles on leaves (stippling). Fine webbing on the underside of leaves is a tell-tale sign of a heavy infestation.",
        "treatment_and_control": "A strong jet of water can dislodge many mites. Insecticidal soaps and horticultural oils are effective but require thorough coverage, especially on the underside of leaves. For severe infestations, specific miticides may be necessary.",
        "prevention": "Spider mites thrive in dry conditions, so maintaining adequate humidity can deter them. Regularly inspect the underside of leaves for early signs. Encourage natural predators like ladybugs and predatory mites.",
        "who_to_contact": "For recommendations on miticides that are safe for vegetables and effective in your area, consult your local nursery or agricultural extension office."

    "Pepper,bell__Bacterial_spot": {
        "Description": "Bacterial Spot on peppers is caused by Xanthomonas bacteria and is one of the most destructive diseases for this crop. It causes water-soaked spots on leaves that later turn dark and may have a 'shot-hole' appearance. On fruit, it causes raised, scab-like spots.",
        "treatment_and_control": "Control is very difficult. Copper-based bactericides can be used, but they are often not fully effective, especially in rainy weather. They primarily serve to protect healthy tissue. Avoid working in the fields when plants are wet.",
        "prevention": "Planting resistant bell pepper varieties is the most effective management tool. Always use certified disease-free seed and transplants. Practice crop rotation for at least one year. Mulch to prevent soil splash.",
        "who_to_contact": "Crucially, consult your local agricultural extension office or seed supplier for the best resistant varieties for your region."

    "Corn_(maize)___healthy": {
        "Description": "Looks great! Your corn plant is healthy. A healthy corn stalk is sturdy with broad, green leaves. It should be developing tassels and silks at the appropriate growth stage, and the ears should be filling out well.",
        "treatment_and_control": "No treatment is needed. A healthy stand of corn is on track for a good harvest.",
        "prevention": "To ensure a healthy corn crop: 1. Plant in well-fertilized soil, as corn is a heavy feeder, especially of nitrogen. 2. Ensure consistent watering, particularly during the critical silking and ear-fill stages. 3. Plant in blocks of at least four rows rather than a single long row to ensure good pollination. 4. Manage weeds to reduce competition for nutrients and water.",
        "who_to_contact": "For advice on fertilization timing and pest management in your area, your local agricultural extension office is the best resource."
